	<p style="color:rgb(255, 119, 0)"><u>1. Student Record Database Management System</u></p><p>The project was implemented in order to efficiently manage all the details of the students required by the college/school. The system uses a unique identification numberto access the student details. The data is allowed access by only the office admin. Student details can be inserted, deleted and</br> viewed easily through this system.</br></p>
<p align="left">Duration of the project: 1 Month</br>
OS/Language/DB: Ubuntu/Python3/SQLite3<br>
Team Size: 3</br>
My Role: Team Lead, Backend Development with Complete Integration</br>
Outcome of the project: User friendly database management system with end-to-end data structured systematically.</br> UAT has concluded as error free, seamless and user oriented system. The team has learned practical application of SDLC and project management approach.</br>

Implemented a virtual simulation of a smart home through which lights can be remotely controlled,  room temperature is measured and  rise in toxic gas level, combustible gas level is indicated. Presence of intruders at home and sudden fire is sensed and informed.</br></br>
Duration of the project: 3 days</br>
OS/Language/Platform: Windows/Arduino/Proteus</br>
My Role: Individual</br>
Outcome of the project: The virtual simulation has showed that a smart home can be created physically with the equipments used in the simulation.</p>
